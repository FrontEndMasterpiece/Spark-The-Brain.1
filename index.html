            As of lately, many lower tax bracket social status citizens have been forced against the ropes.  Battling issues concerning finances, 
            funding for education, gas price hikes, and degradation of key legislature.  Policies once meant to provide means for support, are now 
            barriers of strain.  With congressional districts deciding to supplement unemployment with monetary stimulus funding, due to government mandates 
            shunning the expansion of manpower-inflation has been at an all-time high.

            <p>Petty crimes such as car theft is on the rise.  Families confronted with generational indigence have come to a cross roads without no 
                sight of resolve.  There is no diagnosis or instruction for that individual without a solid support system.  But he/she should know 
                that on ever road to choosing their will be curves, obstacles, uphill battles, and downhill bumps.  However, sooner or later they 
                will reach their destination and at that point promptly come to the realization that every root, stone, or bump along the journey 
                through muddy waters was meant to prepare them for that new position in leadership.
